<h1>Hiking as a Lifetime Past-time</h1>
        <div class="pull-left"><img src="./images/hiking01.jpg"/></div>

<p>It is not hard to figure out why hiking is such a desirable pastime. Some hiking trails run across state lines and cover a country's most beautiful natural spots. Most people already know that hiking comes with great physical demands like walking for hours with a backpack of heavy supplies. Carrying a heavy load and walking for miles in an open territory are reasons why hikers should learn how to stay safe during their treks. This safety guide teaches new and experienced hikers about common mistakes that hikers make, tips they should follow both before and during a hike, hiking guidelines for families, and advice on what to do after a hike. Hikers must prepare themselves well by familiarizing themselves with most of the hazards and safety tips involved so they can hike successfully.</p>

<h2>Having Fun Includes Staying Safe</h2>

<p>A mistake has the power to bring minor discomfort to hikers or it can cost them their lives. Many outdoor adventurers make mistakes but the greatest and most experienced ones will learn from their mishaps or prevent them altogether. Common hiking mistakes happen from simple carelessness like choosing the wrong path or not bringing a map. With a single mistake, hikers can lose many hours if they get hopelessly lost or even lose thousands of dollars if they lose valuable safety equipment. The best hikers will know how to avoid typical mistakes that are committed every day on the trail.</p>

<h2>Tips for Safe Hiking</h2> 
      
<div class="pull-left"><img src="./images/hiking02.jpg"/></div>
        <p>Hiking is a fun, healthy, and affordable activity that is open to anyone. Anyone can get the most out of hiking and remain safe at the same time. Several outdoor organizations promote a list known as the Ten Essentials that lists important hiking equipment. Some basic outdoor survival items include a compass, map, lighter, water, food, and weather gear. Other useful tips for hikers include informing family or friends about a trip, taking a cell phone, and gaining knowledge about possible natural dangers. Hikers should know about the location they want to visit, use any outdoor experience, and take advantage of their common sense. Long-distance hiking will increase the risks of dehydration, fatigue, hazardous water crossings, hypothermia, insect-borne diseases contractions, and animal attacks. Remaining aware and prepared in addition to planning ahead are the main ways that hikers can prevent disasters from happening.</p>

<h2>Prepare Your Body</h2>
<div class="pull-left"><img src="./images/hiking03.jpg"/></div>
<p>Hiking can take a physical toll on many hikers who come from all fitness backgrounds and experience levels. Hikers should pay attention to negative body signs so they do not go beyond their limits. Even though conditioning will make hikers last longer on the trails, resting is just as important. Hikers who have become injured should not take their pain lightly and should obtain proper medical help. Hikers who are just sore should take the time to relax or massage their uncomfortable areas. In addition to monitoring health, monitoring progress is a task that involves writing updates about hiking goals, health, and experiences. Hikers should also review important hiking tips like the Hiker Responsibility Code on a routine basis.</p>

<h2>Winter Wildlife Feeding</h2>
        <div class="pull-left"><img src="./images/winterwildlife.jpg"/></div>
<p>When the temperature drops and snow falls, many people want to feed deer and other wildlife. While the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) conducts winter feeding under certain conditions, we generally discourage citizens from feeding deer, elk and other wildlife species because of the potential for harm.</p>
      
<p>Deer, elk and other animals have developed adaptations that allow them to survive harsh winter conditions without human intervention.  These adaptations include building fat and muscle during the summer growing season, migrating long distances, dispersing across the landscape to reduce concentrations, lowering metabolic rates during the winter season, and restricting movements during severe winter conditions to conserve energy.</p>
      
<p>The best way to help wild animals survive a severe winter is to promote year-round quality habitat. If animals go into the winter in good condition, most are able to survive persistent deep snow, ice and cold temperatures. Even in well-functioning natural ecosystems, however, some animals succumb during winter months. The winter season helps keep wildlife populations more in balance with available habitat.</p>
      
<p>Another way to help wild animals in winter is to avoid disturbing them. Animals must conserve their energy to survive winter conditions, and human disturbance causes them to move about. Keep dogs confined, and slow down when traveling in motor vehicles through deer and elk habitat.
The greatest drawback to feeding deer or elk is the potential harm to their health.</p>
      
<p>The digestive systems of free-ranging elk and deer are not able to use many types of artificial feed efficiently. Fruit and grains are not a normal part of a deer's diet and can be extremely difficult for deer to digest. Their rumens need time to adjust to a high carbohydrate diet, and they can die from rumen acidosis when experiencing a rapid transition from normal forage to fruit or grain.</p>
      
<p>Corn and apples are especially hard for them to digest because the gut microbes needed to break them down are different than those that break down their more fibrous natural foods during winter. This mismatch in gut microbes can result in animals that starve because they are unable to absorb the nutrients they need. In addition, fruit and grains don't have the right amounts and types of vitamins, minerals, and especially fiber that deer and elk need to stay healthy. Feeding these alternative foods is similar to feeding your children nothing but candy bars.</p>
      
<p>Even with a specially formulated pelletized deer feed (as is used by WDFW in special circumstances), the process to successfully feed deer is complex. Any shift in foods must happen gradually over weeks to allow gut microbes to adjust .While loss of body fat over the winter is a natural part of the cycle, the additional energy used for diet adjustment can speed up the process of weight loss. Once a diet shift has occurred, feeding must be continued until they can adjust back to natural foods in the spring.</p>
      
<p>The final cost of feeding can be substantial. If an average deer eats three to four pounds of feed per day over four months, one deer could consume almost 500 pounds of feed.</p>
      
<p>Concentrating deer and elk at a feeder can create problems by making the animals more vulnerable to disease, predation and poaching. If feeding areas draw animals across well-traveled roads, they are more likely to present a safety hazard and be hit by cars. Deer and elk drawn to artificial feed also can damage nearby agricultural areas, trees, or landscaping, especially if the artificial feed supply is not maintained through the winter.</p>
      
<p>Wildlife biologists recognize that it is not effective nor beneficial to attempt winter feeding throughout the state, and we don't have the resources to do so. However, in special circumstances we provide carefully managed supplemental feeding programs for certain wildlife populations.</p>

<p>For example, at WDFW's Oak Creek, L.T. Murray and Wenas wildlife areas in south-central Washington, elk and bighorn sheep are fed throughout the winter. In concert with extensive fencing, the feeding program helps keep elk and bighorn sheep off adjacent private property where they may cause damage or contract diseases from domestic animals. A side benefit of this traditional feeding program is a public wildlife-viewing opportunity.</p>

<p>In other instances, wildlife biologists may feed wild animals to draw them in for capture to monitor their health or for relocation projects.</p>
